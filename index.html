The objective of the game is to control a bird and guide it through gaps between vertically aligned pipes without collision. The project demonstrates fundamental principles of front-end development such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and animation using requestAnimationFrame. The game's physics, including gravity and motion control, are simulated using simple JavaScript logic. Collision detection is implemented to determine game over conditions when the bird hits a pipe or the ground. The user interface is responsive and offers real-time interaction, making it both fun to play and a solid example of interactive web programming. This project highlights the practical application of programming concepts and provides a foundation for developing more advanced browser-based games in future academic or personal projects.">✨ Enhance Description</button>

For example, one of my key projects was developing a Flappy Bird game clone using JavaScript. This project taught me how to handle game logic, animations, and user input effectively. It also improved my problem-solving skills as I optimized the game performance for smooth gameplay.

Additionally, I worked on a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills, projects, and articles. Building this site from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript deepened my understanding of responsive design and user experience.

Through these hands-on experiences, I am confident in my ability to take on real-world challenges and continue growing as a developer.">Read More📖🖥️</button>

Over the years, I have developed strategies to manage my time and tasks efficiently while maintaining quality in both areas.

One important tip is to plan your projects early. Breaking down a project into smaller tasks with deadlines helps avoid last-minute stress and ensures steady progress. I always start by outlining the project requirements and creating a timeline for each feature.

Another key practice is to integrate your project work with your studies. Whenever possible, I choose projects related to subjects I’m currently studying. This reinforces theoretical knowledge and makes practical work more meaningful.

Lastly, don’t hesitate to seek help from professors or peers when stuck. Collaboration and communication are essential skills that will benefit you throughout your academic and professional journey.

With consistent effort and proper planning, managing both studies and projects at LPU becomes a rewarding experience.
